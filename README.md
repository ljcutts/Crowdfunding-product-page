## Overview
This is my 4th Project from Frontend Mentor and first time using React and styled components on my own.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- Make a selection of which pledge to make
- See an updated progress bar and total money raised based on their pledge total after confirming a pledge
- See the number of total backers increment by one after confirming a pledge
- Toggle whether or not the product is bookmarked

## My process
I first started building out the mobile version than the desktop version. I would export my app to Netlify to see what it looks like on a mobile device. While building out the versions, I first built the home page, then in the correct order, I built out the modals. Once I built all of the components to the app, I started to add in the functionality and different states in terms of toggles and hovering over buttons.

### Built with
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned that things can get a little tricky with CSS when you are building the mobile and desktop version of the app. Also, I have more of an understanding of how useState, useRef work, and how to allow components to borrow hooks through different coding files. Furthermore, I learned that it comes in handy updating your code to Github a lot when you've made a lot of progress. I learned how 'npm run build' works. I learned the process of building modal components.

### Continued development

I want to get much better at being able to handle CSS when building out the mobile and desktop versions of the app. I want to continue to perfect React Hooks and using React in general. I want to get better at coming up with better Javascript functions. I want to be able to implement other React Hooks in the future.
